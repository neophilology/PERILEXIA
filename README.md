# PERILEXIA

PERILEXIA is an **empirically grounded, algorithmic framework for literary analysis** that introduces a new narratological category by computationally detecting transformation lexemes and focalization, moving beyond traditional corpus-based approaches to ensure reproducibility and rigor.

## Overview
This repository provides:
- An algorithm to **detect focalization** in narrative texts.
- A method for **identifying transformation lexemes**: perilexia
- A **reproducible workflow** that connects data science and narratology.

## Features
- **NLP pipeline** tailored to literary corpora.
- Integration of Aristotelian taxonomy for interpretive rigor of **dramatic arc**.
- Outputs that support both **distant** and **close reading** practices.

## Usage
Instructions for installation and running the code will be added soon.
(For now: see the scripts in `/src` and examples in `/notebooks`.)
